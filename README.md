# Analyze-Texts
R Shiny app for analyzing texts from Gutenberg project

https://amitsharmar.shinyapps.io/analyzetext/

By default, application downloads classic 'Pride and Prejudice' by Jane Austen and does sentiment analysis on it.
To use the app, enter the name of a classic English book. Application will search the name on Gutenbergr project and return the search results. It takes more than 1 minute to return the search results. And also, type the name starting with a capital letter. Such as 'Hamlet' instead of 'hamlet'.

Next, enter Gutenbergr id in the text field. App will download the book, do sentimenta analysis on it and shows most frequent words in the book. As I am a Maths guy, I like to see numbers instead of a word cloud.

Future Work:- radio buttons 'Author', 'ID' and 'Topic' haven't been programmed yet.
